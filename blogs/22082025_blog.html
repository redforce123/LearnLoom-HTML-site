            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-2 max-w-3xl mx-auto">Studying for a math or science exam can feel overwhelming. You have to remember complex concepts, tricky methods, and—of course—all those formulas! But what if there was a tool that could help you ace your tests without relying solely on a perfect memory?</p>

            <p>That's where formula sheets come in.</p>
            
            <h2>What Exactly Is a Formula Sheet?</h2>
            <p>
                A formula sheet is exactly what it sounds like: a single-page reference containing all the essential formulas, equations, and constants you'll need for a specific class or exam. It's a quick-reference guide that helps you recall key information during problem-solving. While some exams provide them, creating your own is a powerful study technique.
            </p>

            <h2>The Benefits of Using a Formula Sheet</h2>
            <p>
                Using a formula sheet is about more than just having a cheat sheet for a test. It’s about learning smarter, not harder.
            </p>
            <div class="space-y-6 not-prose">
                <div class="p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-[#EA0264]">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Reduces Exam Stress</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">When you're in an exam, worrying that you'll forget a crucial formula can eat up valuable mental energy. Having a formula sheet frees your mind to focus on the actual problem. It's like a safety net that lets you focus on understanding and applying the concepts.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-[#EA0264]">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Improves Conceptual Understanding</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">This is a big one! Instead of rote memorization, a formula sheet forces you to focus on when and why a specific formula is used. You have to look at the problem, analyze the variables, and then choose the correct tool from your sheet. This process strengthens your conceptual knowledge far more than simple recall.</p>

                <div class="p-6 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-[#EA0264]">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Boosts Problem-Solving Efficiency</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">In real-world applications (and on timed tests!), speed matters. With a formula sheet, you can quickly find the equation you need and jump straight into solving the problem, saving you precious time and allowing you to tackle more questions.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">A Powerful Study Tool</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">The act of creating your own formula sheet is one of the most effective ways to study. You have to review all your material, decide what's most important, and organize it logically. This active process helps you identify patterns and connections between different topics, solidifying your understanding.</p>
